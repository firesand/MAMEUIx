# MAMEUIX Changelog

## [0.1.3] - 2024-12-19

### 🚀 **Major Performance Improvements**

#### **Thread Pool Icon Loading System**
- **Replaced single-threaded queue** with **rayon thread pool** for parallel icon loading
- **Automatic scaling** to CPU cores (max 8 threads) for optimal performance
- **Non-blocking UI operations** during icon loading
- **Adaptive loading rate** based on current FPS (1-8 icons per frame)
- **Thread-safe queue** using `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque>>` for concurrent access
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed metrics and statistics

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Parallel processing** of icon loading operations
- **Memory-efficient caching** with automatic cleanup
- **Reduced UI lag** during large game library loading
- **Better resource management** for 48,000+ games

### 🎨 **UI Enhancements**

#### **Enhanced Window Resizing**
- **Properties dialog**: Increased default size to 600x550 (was 500x450)
- **Maximum size**: Extended to 1200x900 (was 800x700)
- **Better proportions**: More suitable for extensive configuration options
- **Window persistence**: Size and position remembered between sessions
- **Dynamic scroll areas**: Content adapts to available space

#### **Improved Game History Layout**
- **Better proportions**: History panel now 55% vs Artwork 45% (was 40%/60%)
- **Enhanced text display**: More rows visible by default (20 rows)
- **Better readability**: Improved formatting and spacing
- **Reduced scrolling**: More MAME info content fits in visible area
- **Professional appearance**: Cleaner tab layout and spacing

#### **General UI Improvements**
