## Changes Made

### 3. Enhanced Visual Styling

#### Header Improvements
- Increased header height from 24px to 32px
- Added subtle borders and better background styling
- Improved text styling with larger font size (14px)
- Added left padding for better alignment

#### Row Improvements
- Added consistent left padding (4-8px) to all columns
- Enhanced favorite star styling with gold color for favorites
- Improved status icons with color coding:
  - Green for available games
  - Red for missing games
  - Grey for unknown status
- Better text hierarchy with different sizes for parent vs clone games

#### Table Spacing
- Added horizontal spacing (8px) between columns
- Added vertical spacing (4px) between rows
- Improved overall visual breathing room

### 4. New Modern Card Theme
Added a new "Modern Card" theme that provides:
- Light, modern appearance
- Card-like design with subtle borders
- Material Design color scheme
- Better contrast and readability
- Reduced "spreadsheet" appearance

### 5. Compact Mode Toggle
Added a preference option to toggle between:
- **Spacious Mode** (default): Uses the improved spacing
- **Compact Mode**: Uses the original tighter spacing for users who prefer it

## How to Use the Improvements

### Switching to Modern Card Theme
1. Go to Settings/Preferences
2. Select "Modern Card" from the Theme dropdown
3. The UI will immediately update with the new styling

### Adjusting Column Visibility
To reduce clutter, you can hide less important columns:
1. Right-click on the game list header
2. Uncheck columns you don't need
3. Recommended minimal setup: Game, Status, Year, Category

### Using Compact Mode
If you prefer the original tighter spacing:
1. Go to Settings/Preferences
2. Check "Use Compact Mode"
3. The UI will switch to the original spacing

## Benefits

1. **Better Readability**: Larger text and more spacing make games easier to read
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Better visual hierarchy and spacing reduce cognitive load
3. **Modern Appearance**: Less "spreadsheet-like" and more app-like
4. **Accessibility**: Better touch targets and contrast ratios
5. **Flexibility**: Users can choose between spacious and compact modes

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/ui/panels/game_list.rs`: Main UI improvements
- `src/models/config.rs`: New theme and column width defaults
- `src/models/mod.rs`: Added compact mode preference

### Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact from spacing changes
- Virtual scrolling still maintains good performance
- Theme changes are instant and don't affect performance

## Future Improvements

1. **Card View Mode**: Alternative to table view with game cards
2. **Customizable Spacing**: User-defined spacing preferences
3. **Column Presets**: Predefined column configurations for different use cases
4. **Responsive Design**: Better adaptation to different screen sizes
